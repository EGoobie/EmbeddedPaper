 title = {Klopfenstein tapered 2 \#x2013;18 {GHz} microstrip balun},
 doi = {10.1109/IBCAST.2012.6177579},
 abstract = {Tapered microstrip Balun is used as an impedance transformer network in feeding sections of spiral antennas as it provides impedance transformation over a large range of frequency and also serves the purpose of conversion of single ended port to a symmetric port. The conversion from unbalanced to balanced line relies on a gradual change of cross section of the line. This paper presents a 2-18 {GHz} microstrip Balun that uses the Klopfenstein equations for the taper. The Balun structure was first simulated in Ansoft {HFSS} and then fabricated; there was a close match between the simulated and measured results.},
