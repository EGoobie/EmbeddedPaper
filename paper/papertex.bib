	abstract = {A microstrip rat-race coupler with high isolation and perfect balance is presented. By modifying March's rat-race coupler with two additional short-circuited stubs, the isolation and the amplitude/phase balance of the proposed coupler improve significantly. The circuit can be easily fabricated on a single-layer substrate using the conventional printed circuit board process.},

	abstract = {New designs of wide-band rat-race couplers are proposed. The wide-band operation is achieved with the use of the microstrip nonuniform transmission line sections for the branches of the conventional rat-race coupler. The design formulas are developed using {ABCD} matrix and the even- and odd-mode analysis. The theoretical analysis has been verified by measurements of the two manufactured wideband rat-race couplers, one operate within 0.85–1.92 {GHz} and other within 1.55–3.55 {GHz} frequency range with the equal normalized characteristic impedance functions. For both fabricated couplers, the isolation parameter is better than 15 {dB} over a 77\% relative bandwidth. Also, it is shown that the designed wide-band rat-race coupler can be realized in higher frequency bands with the fixed fractional bandwidth. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
